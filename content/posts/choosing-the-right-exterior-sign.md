Below are the key factors to consider when selecting an exterior sign that truly works for your business.

## 1. Start With Visibility and Readability

An effective exterior sign must be easy to read at a glance. This depends on several factors:

- **Letter size:** Larger lettering is essential for visibility from the street or parking lot.
- **Font choice:** Clean, simple fonts perform better than decorative styles.
- **Contrast:** High contrast between text and background improves readability in all lighting conditions.

If customers have to slow down or squint to read your sign, it’s not doing its job.

## 2. Choose Materials That Match Your Environment

Exterior signs are exposed to sun, wind, rain, and temperature changes. The right material ensures your sign looks good for years, not months.

Common material options include:

- **Acrylic:** Modern, polished, and great for dimensional lettering.
- **Aluminum:** Lightweight, rust-resistant, and ideal for long-term outdoor use.
- **PVC or composite panels:** Cost-effective and versatile for many applications.

Your location, climate, and building exposure all play a role in material selection.

## 3. Decide Between Illuminated and Non-Illuminated Signs

Lighting can significantly impact visibility, especially in the evening or early morning.

- **Illuminated signs** help businesses stand out after dark and are ideal for storefronts, offices, and medical facilities.
- **Non-illuminated signs** can still be effective when paired with good placement and natural lighting.

The right choice depends on your operating hours and surrounding environment.

## 4. Keep Branding Consistent

Your exterior sign should feel like a natural extension of your brand:

- Use brand colors consistently
- Match the tone of your logo and interior signage
- Maintain a professional, cohesive look across all customer touchpoints

A well-branded sign builds trust and makes your business easier to recognize.
